\usage{
seeding_estimate_constant(
  intercept_prior_q5 = NULL,
  intercept_prior_q95 = NULL,
  extend = TRUE,
  modeldata = modeldata_init()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{intercept_prior_q5}{Prior (5\% quantile) on the initial number of
infections. Can be interpreted as an approximate lower bound. If NULL
(default), this is computed from a crude empirical estimate of the number
of cases (see details).}

\item{intercept_prior_q95}{Prior (95\% quantile) on the initial number of
infections. Can be interpreted as an approximate upper bound. If NULL
(default), this is computed from a crude empirical estimate of the number
of cases (see details).}

\item{extend}{Should the seeding phase be extended when concentrations are
very low at the start of the measurement time series? If \code{TRUE}, then the
seeding phase will be extended to the first date with three consecutive
detects (i.e. non-zero measurements). Before that date, the reproduction
number will be retrospectively computed based on the seeded infections.
Explicit modeling of the Rt time series will only begin after the seeding
phase. This option avoids sampling problems when estimating Rt from very
low infection numbers during a period with many non-detects. Note that
estimated reproduction numbers are not necessarily meaningful during
periods with very low infection numbers, as transmission dynamics may be
dominated by chance events and importations.}

\item{modeldata}{A \code{modeldata} object to which the above model specifications
should be added. Default is an empty model given by \code{\link[=modeldata_init]{modeldata_init()}}. Can
also be an already partly specified model returned by other \code{EpiSewer}
modeling functions.}
}
\value{
A \code{modeldata} object containing data and specifications of the model
to be fitted. Can be passed on to other \code{EpiSewer} modeling functions to
add further data and model specifications.

The \code{modeldata} object also includes information about parameter
initialization (\code{.init}), meta data (\code{.metainfo}), and checks to be
performed before model fitting (\code{.checks}).
}
\description{
This option estimates a constant number of infections at the
start of the modeled time period.
}
\details{
The seeding phase has the length of the maximum generation time
(during this time, the renewal model cannot be applied). It is here assumed
that the expected number of new infections stays constant over this time
period. This assumption can however be violated: While traditionally,
seeding refers to the first few (potentially imported) infections of an
epidemic, depending on what time period the model is fitted to, it may also
cover a different phase with stronger growth dynamics. Thus, if your data
starts in the middle of an epidemic wave, it is recommended to use
\code{\link[=seeding_estimate_growth]{seeding_estimate_growth()}} instead of \code{\link[=seeding_estimate_constant]{seeding_estimate_constant()}}.

If \code{intercept_prior_q5} or \code{intercept_prior_q95} are not specified
by the user, \code{EpiSewer} will compute a rough median empirical estimate of
the number of cases using the supplied wastewater measurements and shedding
assumptions, and then infer the missing quantiles based on this. If none of
the quantiles are provided, they are set to be roughly 1/10 and 10 times
the empirical median estimate. We note that this is a violation of Bayesian
principles (data must not be used to inform priors) - but a neglectable
one, since it only ensures that the seeding is modeled on the right order
of magnitude and does not have relevant impacts on later Rt estimates.

The priors of this component have the following functional form:
\itemize{
\item initial number of infections (log scale): \code{Normal}
}
