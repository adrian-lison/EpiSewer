\usage{
model_shedding(
  incubation_dist = incubation_dist_assume(),
  shedding_dist = shedding_dist_assume(),
  load_per_case = load_per_case_assume(),
  load_variation = load_variation_none()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{incubation_dist}{Incubation period distribution. \code{EpiSewer} uses this
as a proxy for the time between infection and the start of shedding, as
shedding load distributions in the literature are often given from symptom
onset onwards. If the assumed shedding load distribution instead starts
from the time of infection, the incubation period should be fixed to 0
days. Modeling options:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=incubation_dist_assume]{incubation_dist_assume()}}
}}

\item{shedding_dist}{Shedding load distribution. Describes how the total load
shed by an individual is distributed over time (and therefore sums to 1).
Modeling options:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=shedding_dist_assume]{shedding_dist_assume()}}
}}

\item{load_per_case}{Average total load per case. This is a scaling factor
that describes how many pathogen particles are shed by the average infected
individual overall and how much of this is detectable at the sampling site.
It depends both on biological factors as well as on the specific
sewage system. Modeling options:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=load_per_case_assume]{load_per_case_assume()}}
}}

\item{load_variation}{Individual-level shedding load variation. The strength
of shedding may vary between individuals. Modeling this variation can better
account for uncertainty especially at low incidence. Modeling options:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=load_variation_estimate]{load_variation_estimate()}}
\item \code{\link[=load_variation_none]{load_variation_none()}}
}}
}
\value{
A \code{modeldata} object containing the data and specifications of the
\code{shedding} module.
}
\description{
This module function is used to specify the components of the
\code{shedding} module in \code{EpiSewer}.

Each component can be specified using one or several helper
functions (see available options below). See the documentation of the
individual helper functions to adjust model priors and further settings.
